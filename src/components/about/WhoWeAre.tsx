          The Chinese Student Association (CSA) at UC Riverside is a social,
          cultural, and service orientated organization that strives to promote
          the Chinese American culture throughout the UCR and Riverside
          communities. We provide various opportunities and events throughout
          the year that allow students to develop leadership skills and also
          provide a social outlet for students with similar backgrounds and
          interests. Our organization is a great way to meet lifelong friends
          and create fond memories that will contribute to a successful college
          experience and beyond!
