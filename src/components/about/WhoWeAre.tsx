        The Chinese Student Association (CSA) at UC Riverside is a social,
        cultural, and service orientated organization that strives to promote
        the Chinese American culture throughout the UCR and Riverside
        communities. We provide various opportunities and events throughout the
        year that allow students to develop leadership skills and also provide a
        social outlet for students with similar backgrounds and interests. Our
        organization is a great way to meet lifelong friends and create fond
        memories that will contribute to a successful college experience and
        beyond!{" "}
